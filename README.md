# Flutter package: `killswitch`

Documentation is found largely in the package itself via doc-comments. This is useful after you get started. Quick-start guide found [here](https://matthewtrent.me/articles/killswitch).

In the meantime, here's a small taste showing how simple the package is to use:

```dart
Killswitch(
	killAndWhitelistSourceUrl:  "https://example.com", // <-- your URL
	child: ...
);
```
